 # HomeTeach ![Android Build](https://github.com/hngi/mobileforce-HomeTeach/workflows/Android%20Build/badge.svg)

## App Description
HomeTeach software provides a platform for experienced teachers in the society to register and retail their services. The concept of the app is inspired by the imperative need to take education into the digital stratosphere. It seeks to create a platform where parents (or students) can seek for tutors with professional experience for their wards (or themselves).
Teachers register and the organization screens them to ensure the necessary standards are met. Parents (or students) can subscribe, log in and select their subject and are able to choose a teacher from the list of available teachers. Arrangements for classes are made and the subscriber will be debited at month ends. Subscribers are able to rate/feedback teachers on the app so that future subscribers can be guided on their choice.
HomeTeach develops a robust paid learning experience for students with education level put in place and matched with the right tutor. Running on a subscription system, parents pay for expert knowledge, tutors get paid for services rendered, further reducing bottlenecks associated with these services outside the digital enviroment.

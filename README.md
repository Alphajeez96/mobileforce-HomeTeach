 # HomeTeach.

## Description
HomeTeach software provides a platform for experienced teachers in the society to register and retail their services. 
Teachers register and the organization screens them to ensure the necessary standards are met. 
Parents in search of teachers to assist their wards can subscribe, log in and select their subject and are able to choose a teacher from the list of available teachers.
Arrangements for classes are made and the subscriber will be debited at month ends.
Subscribers are able to rate/feedback teachers on the app so that future subscribers can be guided on their choice.
